A recreation of my version of the game 'Mastermind' in C++. 

Just polishing up my C skills after a few years vacationing with Python. Took me a few hours and some googling.

In this game you are trying to find the hidden number combination. Every number in the combination is only used once. If you guess a correct number in the wrong space the 'close' count will go up by one. If you guess a correct number in the correct space the 'match' count will go up one.

Not quite finished. Mostly works just need to handle invalid inputs and stuff. Will do soonish.
